# simple-social-network
design and implement an application that maintains the data for a simple social network. Each person in the network should have a profile that contains the person’s name, optional image, current status, and a list of friends. Your application should allow a user to join the network, leave the network, create a profile, modify the profile, search for other profiles, and add friends. Track the friend relationships among members of the network. Add a feature to enable people to see a list of their friends’ friends.  This project must include GUI – Graphical User Interface.
